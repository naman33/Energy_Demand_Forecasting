# Energy_Demand_Forecasting
In this project, I built a time series forecasting model to predict future energy demands using the ARIMA algorithm. I started by performing exploratory data analysis to understand underlying trends, seasonality, and stationarity in the dataset. To fine-tune the ARIMA parameters, I used statistical techniques like ADF (Augmented Dickey-Fuller) test, ACF, and PACF plots. After training the model, I visualized the forecasted results along with confidence intervals using Matplotlib and Seaborn, which helped in interpreting the predictions clearly. The model gave accurate results on real-world data, making it useful for anticipating future energy usage patterns
